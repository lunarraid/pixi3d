## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added `destroy` function to an instanced model.
- Added functionality to create a `Color` object from bytes.

### Changed
- Turn off writing to depth buffer when rendering transparent objects using `StandardMaterial`. This feature if only available in PixiJS 6.0+.
- `Color` default alpha has been changed to 1 instead of 0.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused mesh instances to be rendered even if they were `visible = false`.
- Fixed an issue which caused `StandardMaterial` not to render double sided materials correctly.
- Using `StandardMaterial` alpha mode "mask" previously rendered the object as transparent, this should no longer be the case.
- Fixed `StandardMaterial` shader for Safari with WebGL 2.0 enabled.

## [0.9.5] - 2021-05-09
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused WebGL errors when using instancing.

## [0.9.4] - 2021-05-08
### Added
- Support for creating a `Cubemap` from colors.
- Support for instancing using `createInstance` on `Mesh3D` or `Model`.
- Simple `Color` class with RGBA components.
- Math functionality: `Vec3`, `Quat`, `Mat4`, `Plane` and `Ray`.
- Support for loading binary glTF (.glb) files.
- Additional components for `TransformMatrix`.
- Convert screen coordinates to a `Ray` using `Camera`.
- Enable/disable render passes on `Mesh3D`.

### Changed
- Renamed `texture` to `cubemap` on a resource loaded from a cubemap file.
- Renamed `CubeMipmapTexture` to `Cubemap`.
- Renamed `renderType` to `renderSortType` on `Material`.
- Renamed `renderPasses` to `enabledRenderPasses` on `Mesh3D`.
- Renamed `texture` to `cubemap` on `Skybox`.
- Use `Color` instead of array on `StandardMaterial`, `MaterialRenderPass` and `Light`.
- Renamed `CubeMipmapResource` to `CubemapResource`.
- `Skybox.from` takes an object as an argument instead of a string.
- Renamed `setFromMultiplyWorldLocal` to `setFromMultiply` on `TransformMatrix`.

### Removed
- `Cubemap.fromSource` was removed, use `Cubemap.fromFaces` instead.
- `TransformMatrix` `target` property was removed, use math functionality instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed loading of glTF assets pointing to same resources.
- Honor `stopped` interactions for `CameraOrbitControl`.
